# Emoji Translator

Emojis have become the _lingua franca_ of modern society. They are a fun and
fast way to communicate, but an also extremely expressive mechanism for
communicating emotions and reactions.

The objective of the Emoji Translator app is to translate text entered by the
user into an equivalent string of emojis, translated from one or more words in
the original text, and words for which there is no corresponding emoji.
